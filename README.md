# ConcentrationGame
Description:
 Remember the concentration game that you might have played as a kid with some cards. The idea of the game is to find identical pairs among a shuffled pack of cards laid out. For example, let us assume that you are given 10 cards in the deck, with two Aces, two Queens, two 5â€™s, two Jacks and two labeled 9. The cards are shuffled and placed face down on the table.  
 A player then selects two cards that are face down, turns them face up, and if the cards match they are left face up. If the two cards do not match they are returned to their original face down position. The game continues until all cards are face up. 
 Write a program that plays this game of concentration. Use 16 cards that are shuffled and laid out in a 4 by 4 square. These cards should be labeled with pairs of card numbers (A, Q, K, J, 2, 5, 6, 9).  
 Your program should allow the player to specify the cards that she would like to select through a coordinate system. 
 For example, in the following layout:
 1.    1 2 3 4 
 2.  A S $ $ 
 3.  $ $ $ $ 
 3.  $ A $ $ 
 4.  $ $ $ $ 
 
All of the cards are face down indicated by $. The pairs of A which are face up and at coordinates (1,1) and (2,3). To hide the cards that have been temporarily placed face up, output a large number of newlines to force the old board off the screen
